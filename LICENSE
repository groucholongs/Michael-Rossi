Sonons: Even - Based Signal Unit for DSP & Recursive Healing Techniques.

Overview
Sonons are energy packets - Shorts bursts of signal that are localized in time and frequency. I audio DSP, they describe transients (a drum hit, a pluck, a burst of noise). In biomechanics, they desribe muscle firings, grip events, or gait cycles.

Instead of treating biosignals as a endless stream, sonons provide sicrete interpretable units:
Start time t0
Peak frequency f0 (or EMG channel)
Envelope Shape
Total energy
- This makes signals easier to segment, classify, and reuse.

NOTE*
Sonons have appeared in speculative spiritual writing, but here we define them rigorously as discrete time - frequency events in signal processing.
